This is where i documented the process of analyzing the provided unclean data for my final project with the Incubator Hub, using analytic tools like Microsoft Excel, SQL and Microsoft Power BI.  

### DATA SOURCES
The data analysed was from gotten a file called the LITA Capstone Project. The project consists of two source datasets; sales data and customer data.

### ANALYTIC TOOLS USED
## SALES DATA
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com) was used to:
- Perform an initial exploration of the provided data. 
- Using pivot tables, to summarize total sales by product, region, and month.
- Using formulas like =SUM, =IF, =PRODUCT, enabled me to see and understand the summary of the data analysed easily. 

- Structured Query Language [Download Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16) was used to write queries that showed:
- The total sales for each product category.
- The number of sales transactions in each region.
- The highest-selling product by total sales value.
- The total revenue per product.
- The monthly sales totals for each current year.
- The top 5 customers by total purchase amount to name a few. 

Microsoft PowerBI [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-USplatform/products/power-bi) was used to visualize data imported from Microsfot Excel and SQL (Structured Query Language). With PowerBI, I was able to show a summary of relevant data like total revenue per product, region and the most purchased product.
